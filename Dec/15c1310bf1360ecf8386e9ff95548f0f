The University of Abuja in the Nigerian capital has dismissed one of its lecturers over sexual harassment. A female student had alleged that the lecturer, a professor, had demanded sex in exchange for marks. The university said it had acted after reviewing the report of a panel set up to investigate the allegations. In October, the BBC's Africa Eye investigative programme exposed sexual misconduct by lecturers at two top West African universities. The revelations in the "Sex for grades" documentary led to the suspension of some lecturers at both the University of Lagos in Nigeria and the University of Ghana. A separate BBC Africa Eye investigation in December uncovered an illegal network that lured women to India from Africa, where they were then forced into sex work to satisfy the demands of the many African men living in Delhi.
