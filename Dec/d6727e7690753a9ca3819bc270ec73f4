He describes his music as "an urban sound from a smartphone era cantered around a millennial culture". The Kenyan singer-songwriter with a sultry voice has established himself as an ambassador of East African pop culture - until now, Kenya has not had many internationally successful male singers. Brian has a unique style - he sings, and raps as well, and has stepped outside his comfort zone in R&B, delving into other genres of music, including reggae on Cool Vibes and hip-hop on Bonge.

With his unique style and dance moves, the 22-year-old is dancing to the beat of his own drum. This year, the singer made waves with his single Yo Pe - a collaboration with Tanzanian star Diamond Platnumz. In three months, the music video has received over 14 million views on YouTube. Innoss'B has managed to combine the Democratic Republic of Congo's famous rhumba sound with R&B and Afrobeats. End of Youtube post  by Officialinnossb There's no stopping Sho Madjozi. Earlier this year, the South African hip-hop artist won BET Best New International Act. Passion is a big driver for the artist - if you listen to any of her songs or watch a performance from the artist, it is clear she enjoys what she does and that feeling itself is contagious! She has a different take on South Africa's gqom music. This is usually instrumental but she raps - in several languages - over the gqom beat. Many South African artists target their home market but she is managing to connect to people around the world. Her song named after American wrestler John Cena has generated a lot of excitement.
