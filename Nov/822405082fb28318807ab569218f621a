Offers of everything from beer to cooking pots to sportswear streamed in on Friday, along with thousands of pounds worth of donations. Kateka Malobola, a passer-by who filmed the proposal and uploaded it to social media, spoke of his glee following the huge reaction from South Africans. "I took the video and sent it to a group that I've got on my WhatsApp to say 'check this out!' and I put it on Facebook and put it on Instagram, and then boom!" he said in a follow-up video. The love-birds thanked all their well-wishers in a statement to SowetanLIVE.E. The couple also told the website that they had originally married in 2012, but the groom wasn't satisfied with the rings he bought at the time and wanted to buy his wife something better. "I don't work so I didn't have enough cash to give wife Nonhlanhla a befitting wedding/jewellery but wanted to do something small," Hector said. "Thank you South Africa. Your kindness has truly warmed us. We would have never imagined that our love story would have touched so many of you," the couple added.
