There has been an angry response in Kenya to a decision by the authorities to introduce a new salary levy to help build low-cost homes. From next month, employees will pay 1.5% of their pay to the housing fund and that amount will be matched by the employer.

The total monthly payment per person will not exceed $50 (Â£38), but it is hoped that $500m will be raised every year. The Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) says the move to introduce the levy is against a court order, which suspended its introduction pending a hearing on the FKE's objection. A trade union umbrella body has also opposed the money-raising move. President Uhuru Kenyatta wants his second term in office, which began in November 2017, to be defined by what he has called the big four: universal healthcare, improving food security, boosting manufacturing and building affordable housing, The housing levy has been called a tax but at the end of last year Mr Kenyatta said "this is not about tax as it has been made to look, but a saving and a contribution towards owning a house", the Star newspaper quoted him as saying. One consumer rights organisation questioned whether people should be forced to pay the levy, adding in a tweet that the "government has no history of successfully managing any 'fund'".

Others questioned how they could afford the levy while also facing a rise in the cost of living:
